 Scripts and Resources Written in R

 These are scripts that I wrote or have used in various projects.
 In the notes of the scripts, I've indicated individuals who made substantial contributions (sometimes rather large chunks).
 All of these scripts have been influenced by the contributors to online R message boards, especially Stack Exchange.
 I also relied heavily on Norman Matloff's *The art of programming R*.
